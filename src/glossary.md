# Glossary
This section is intended to help decode the verbage, buzzwords, and all sorts of things that sound fancy. 

## CTF Categories
* Pwn: A really cool way of saying binary exploitation, the art of understanding the inner workings of binaries and abusing them to do unintended things. 
* Rev: Short for reverse engineering which is trying to figure out how a thing works from the final result. Usually you will be asked to rev binaries. 
* Web: Short for web exploitation usually involves the exploitation of web technologies (e.g. apparently webassembly pwn was under web once).
* Crypto: Short for cryptography, the art of spotting weaknesses in algorithms used to protect data. Math enjoyers may find this subject suitable.
* Algo: Algorithm, abstract problems that require a strong understanding of algorithms. Not common in most CTFs but competitive programmers may enjoy this.
* Jail: Breaking out of restricted environments, typically python or javascript but can be fancier. For more info google "pyjails" for python jails. Fun category.
* OSINT: Open source intelligence, basically efficient use of online resources to find flag.
* Misc: anything else
